# SearchEngine

Implement Search Engine Performing Full Text Search using Java+MySQL


## Introduction

This projects purpose is to a as a simple search engine. The search engine will take input data from users and return the document id's after the search is done successfully.
Creating the right strategy for optimized research and also ability to store data.

# Overview 

## Application Purpose

This application will present a web application Search Engine.

# Technical stack and Implementations

## Building stack used

 1. MySQL instance using mysql v.8.1 using INNODB engine
 3. Java - JDK 11
 4. Maven - for dependency management/deployment
 5. Jakarta JAX-RS for the web API
 6. Apache Glassfish v.6 -- application server
 7. Jquery library - AJAX for client request
 8. HTML/CSS - client interface

# Environment Preparation

## Back-end Environment

1 - Installation of mysqld and MySQL in local machine

2 -  Create new DB cluster using Xammp console

3 - Create Table document_id_tbl as data storage

4 - Create Index Table from document_id_tbl TERMS column to use for FULL TEXT INDEX functions

5 - Create connection with Java using mysql-connection-java dependency on POM.xml

6 - Install Jersey library for using REST Architecture

7 - Unit Testing using Junit5 Jupiter FrameWork

## Front-end Environment

1 - Run Client interface on NODE JS server.

2 - Create a static HTML+CSS interface

3 - Use Jquery library for async calls using AJAX
